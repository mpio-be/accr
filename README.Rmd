# accr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of accr is to provide a toolkit for working with accelerometer data from small animal studies.

__Note:__ This package is currently in the alpha stage, and its functionality may change significantly in the near future. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of accr from [GitHub](https://github.com/mpio-be/accr) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("mpio-be/accr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to plot an actogram while computing a resting threshold on the fly. 

```{r example}
library(accr)
data(pesaODBA)
setODBA(pesaODBA, "datetime_", "ODBA")
actogram(pesaODBA, threshold = resting_threshold)
```
